This will not replace the original TorChat of course. The reason is that the original torchat (for windows) has no (easier) dependencies. For jTorchat, there is one dependency that is always required... Java of course.

jTorchat stands for Java Torchat, and is a complete rewrite of the popular p2p IM messenger Torchat.

The underlying protocol of jtorchat is based on python Torchat http://code.google.com/p/torchat/

## Philosophy ##

Accessible to All. Alive and connected to All. Transparent to All.

## How we keep to these philosophy ##

  1. Accessible to All = Writing it in java allows for easy portability of code between platforms, perhaps even in android phones.
  1. Alive and connected to All = Broadcast feature, and eventually group chat, will provide talkers the ability to interact as a group, or as a public mass.
  1. Transparent to All = All jtorchat will come with the source, thus increasing transparency and thus security.



## Features from python Torchat ##

  1. Basic Messaging to Torchat users - Done
  1. Popup Alerts - Done
  1. Time Stamp - Done
  1. file transfer - Done
  1. Minimize to tray - Done
  1. Taskbar flashes on msg - How the hell do you do it in java, crossplatform?

## Features extended beyond python Torchat ##

  1. Auto buddy request - done - Helps newcomers find people to talk to
  1. nterface to existing installed tor via GUI - done
  1. Broadcast Mode - done - Allows a message to be sent to everyone in the network (no sender spoofing protection tho)
  1. BuddySync - allows a group to always keep their buddies in sync over tor.
  1. Group Chat - Not Yet - For secure group communication.
  1. FileSharing - allows for calling and downloading files off online buddies.

## Wishlist ##
  1. put budReq'd buddies into a different group
  1. move old buddies from the default group to 'Old buddies' group (but not removing them from user set groups)
