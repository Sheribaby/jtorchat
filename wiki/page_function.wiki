#summary How to use the page function.

= Page function =

The new Page function is for retrieving pages from others automatically.<br/><br/>

With /page "filename" you can retrieve a site from your buddy.<br/>
With /sendpage "filename" you can send a site to your buddy.<br/><br/>

When there is no file in the command, it looks automatically for the page index.<br/>

If you want to deliver pages you need to check "page function" under File->Settings.<br/>
And create a file with the name index.txt and maybe other files with .txt ending in ./data/page.<br/>
Now your client sents this page automatically if someone requests it.
