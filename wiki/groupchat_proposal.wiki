This is a complex concept to do. These are the elements I currenly can think of for groupchat. Please edit your ideas here (or comment below)

RSA signiture verification - for spoof protection

Groupchat Broadcast

----------------

=Proposed Group Chat process=
{{{
Legend(key):
UUID  -(e.g. KHIGIKJ) unique id string that uniquely identifies the chat group 
UserA -(e.g. Andrew) group starter's torchat address
UserB -(e.g. Bokkaa) group participant's torchat address
UserC -(e.g. Smitho) group participant's torchat address (leaves later)
UserD -(e.g. Vandea) group participant's torchat address (joins later)
Sig   - RSA message verification data (for anti-spoofing)
}}}

UserA wants to start a group, so creates a new string with starting information about the group. Lets call it "GroupInfo"

{{{
initial structure of groupInfo:
groupInfo = UUID UserA [UserB] [UserC]
}}}

 * Initial: UserA sends groupInfo to UserB and UserC
 * Initial: Everybody grabs everybody's RSA public key
 * OnUserMsg: The user sends a broadcast msg structured like this:
    # sent: [command] [UUID] [Sig] [Msg] 
    # sent: "groupChat KHIGIKJ [Sig] hey all! How are you"
 * OnRelayMsg: Only relay message to those in the group
 * OnReceive: Verify Sig, then display message. if messgae is unverified/error, then add (unverified) to name.
 * OnLeave: Send a command to all to delete you from list.
 * OnAdd: Send everyone the user's ID
