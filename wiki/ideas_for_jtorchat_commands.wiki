=Harder to implement idea but may be useful (hence is low priority):=

PAGEFILE System - Kind of like 

/page {filename} - request the other user to output to chat window the content from /txt/ folder as text.

/mypage {filename} - same as above, but outputs your own file for the other user.

later on access control should be considered, however I don't know how this can be best implemented. Maybe via password? Maybe via member-list?
/page {filename} {password} 

*Example* "/page FAQ" will tell the other user to search their /txt/ folder for "FAQ" or "FAQ.txt" (basically the first term of the filename). If the other user finds "FAQ"/"FAQ.txt" that user displays the content.
