There are three ways for adding contacts.<br>
1. File->Request buddies. This menu entry automaticly searches for new jTorChat users.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. File->Add contact.<br>
<blockquote>2.1 Address: Here you can write the tor id of your contact.<br>
2.2 Display name: Here you can write the name/nickname of your contact.<br>
<br>
3. File->Settings->Buddy sync<br>
3.1 URL to Buddylist: Tell JTC with which buddylist you want to sync.<br>
<blockquote>Default is: <a href='https://jtorchat.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Buddy_List.wiki'>https://jtorchat.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Buddy_List.wiki</a>
</blockquote>3.2 Sync: If you click here all the buddies from the file will be added.<br>
3.3 sync at every start: if you check this it add the buddies from file at every start. at least if not yet added.
