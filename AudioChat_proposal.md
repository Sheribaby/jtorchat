In the futher future we could perhaps allow for audio technologies to be implemented.

Two types in here:

Using java speech API: we could allow for speech synth of received text. And if possible auto speech transcription, for sending.

We can allow for Push To Talk functionality, via sending voice clips up to 30sec in length, which will auto play on receive (or be ready to play in the chat window).

Doing this will require warning, or recommendation for speech masking, to preserve anonymity.

Potential application of above:

In a seminar, with a famous person who is anonymous, we can still have people presenting questions via 'audio clips'. The answer of the guest speaker can then be displayed via both text (like normal), and via syth (via java speech API)
